However, when they attend the same class im senior year, they get paired to do a project together in which they have to get to know each other. Of course, they both think they have nothing in common, but it is clear as day that this is not the case. She is a good girl, shy and always nice, and he is a bad boy, rich, a player and (who would have thought) doesn't like relationships. Somehow he can't stop thinking about her.\n",

Or so my Aunt Judith told me in her last letter, smelling her tea-pink hand cream, the smell of which unleashed a fresh wave of ugly crying. But I understand what she meant. Not that the house is haunted, but that it haunts me. If I can wave a burning sage and tell myself that I put the ghosts to sleep, I should. What happened there twenty-three years ago does indeed haunt me.\n\nIt's time for me to confront it, so I'm off to Yorkshire, where I'll spend the summer ostensibly on a sabbatical at my great-aunt's country house while I decide what to do with it. What I really want, however, are answers.\n\nAs my cab rolls through the Yorkshire countryside, I mark landmarks as if I were a child again, glued to the window of our rental car as we head for Thorne Manor.

    "description": "Lydia's ex, Anderson, is marrying the woman he cheated on her with, and she has been invited to their wedding. She tells her best friends, Kasha and Henley, she feels like going to the wedding is something she has to do. They don't understand this, but being the great friends that they are they agree to go with her for moral support. Of course, exacting a little revenge on the groom to be a motivating factor as well.\n\nUpon arriving at the venue, Kasha runs into a boy she knew in high school, Roman, ...while she is half-naked. After that, she seems to show up everywhere just to see him make a fool of himself in one way or another. Considering that she is the most accident-prone woman in the world, this happens often. It doesn't take long for them to go from nervousness to titillating each other.\n\nHenley is surprised to learn that her former friend/boyfriend, Davis, is attending the wedding. The last time she saw him she was eighteen, and he had just taken her virginity. Given that he disappeared right after that, she's surprised that he seems as interested in her now as he did when they were together. Davis is even hotter than she remembers, and she quickly decides that it wouldn't hurt to show him exactly what she missed.",

She knows it was murder and is determined to prove it, but as a rookie FBI agent, no one takes her seriously. When another agent is murdered, Special Agent Dominic Sheridan, also a close friend of Vana's, is willing to at least consider what she has to say.\n\nDominic Sheridan came to his position in the FBI on his own merit, not through name and personal connections. Van was more than a friend and his death is especially grave. Ava's concerns are troubling until Dominic is almost killed as well. Now her suspicions are becoming a little too real. They've both been told to leave it alone, the \"Task Force\" will investigate, but the killer has Dominic in their sights and Ava isn't about to let him be harmed, even if it puts her squarely in the killers' sights too. \n",

    "description": "Esther is a servant girl, definitely not a lady, who definitely has a taste for all things sex-related, which in her day is simply scandalous for a woman who is so licentious. After being fired from yet another job, she is invited to become a \"mistress\" at rooksgrave manor, where women serve men who are not men at all.... but monsters. Here we have vampires, Jekyll and Hyde, werewolves, fae, demons, golems, the Sphinx and so on. When Esther starts working at the mansion and is \"matched\" with the various men she is to serve, we definitely see relationships forming. I think that's what I enjoyed most about this book, the relationships. Yes, it's almost all sex, but we actually get to see them falling in love somehow between all the sex. And the author did an excellent job of really differentiating the different personalities of the men. And my god the sex was HOT. You got it all, the denial, the rough, the affectionate, the vouyerism, there's a little bit of everything. Not to mention the sex is with monsters, so expect it to be a little wild. How this author made me want monsters to tear me apart is simply beyond me. Jesus, is it hot in here! While sex was the main selling point of this book, I have to give it to the author for including the fact that every person just wants to be accepted for who they are, kinks and all. And that's what Esther gave her 5 men, acceptance of their monsters in a world that would be disgusted or horrified by them. And they accepted the fact that she wasn't some prim and proper lady who only had sex because a man wanted her to, but she did it because SHE wanted it and wasn't afraid to express her desires.\n",

But when Miles checks security footage one night to see where his brothers are in the building, he comes across footage of Kate in a short red volleyball dress dancing in front of a copier, and for the first time in years she feels something for him.\n",

The school includes a middle school, a high school, a pottery building and a theater. It has continued to grow since the 1920s, adding the new to the old, and now provides education for the needs of 14-year-old students.\n\nThe attacks start with a small explosion, and Rafi, a young refugee from Aleppo, knows from experience exactly what it was. He informs the school principal, Matthew Marr, and rushes to the middle school to evacuate the children and his younger brother, Basi. For many others, it all started when the principal was shot in the head and leg. Drawn to the library by Hannah (Rafi's friend) and her colleague, Mr. Marr is incapacitated for work but fears what is happening in his school.\n\nAs reports circulate via cell phones, the other teachers struggle with fear and nerves to keep the children safe, including Daphne Epelsteiner, the 55-year-old drama teacher, Neil Forbright, the assistant principal, and Beth Alton, a worried parent\n\nThe sense of hidden menace hovers like a thick fog over the school, never knowing if the killer will come out of the fog and shoot someone. The staff try to occupy the children without conveying fear, but their anxiety is palpable. Even worse, there is more than one gunslinger! For three hours, from 9.15am to 12.15pm, the lives of the school's staff, pupils and parents will be changed forever.",

    "description": "Bronwyn recently inherited a large English house (called Thorne Manor) from her aunt.\n\nOh yeah, and he can see ghosts.\n\nThe first time Bronwyn saw ghosts and made the mistake of talking about them, she was hospitalized by her mother. Between a stint in a mental health facility and countless years of therapy, she now believes it was all in her head.\n\nThen he returns to Thorne Manor and everything he thought he knew quickly goes up in flames. Because in addition to seeing ghosts, she's also a time traveler.\n\nHer old bedroom is a kind of seam in time, a little wormhole, and when she's in it, all she has to do is think about it and she falls back in time.\n\nThis mysterious he is William Thorne. Bronwyn met him as a boy, when they were childhood playmates, and then as a teenager, when they shared their first kiss. But then her mother dragged her away from him and hospitalized her. Now 38, Bronwyn and William are strangers to each other, and the last thing Bronwyn expects is to ever see him again.",

Not that the house is haunted, but that it haunts me. If I can wave burning sage and tell myself I've appeased the spirits, then I should. What happened there 23 years ago really haunts me.\n\nIt's time to face this, so I'm heading to Yorkshire, where I'll spend the summer, apparently on sabbatical, at my aunt's country house while I decide what to do with her.

I thrived under the focused attention she gave me.\n\nIn the car on the way to Grandma's, we sang along with the radio to “Walk like an Egyptian,” which was one of our favorites. My mother's bracelets rattled on her arms as she made the gesture of an Egyptian dancer. I laughed and imitated her, pointing with my hands like a sculpture on King Tut's tomb.

    "description": "Esther “Essie” Hicks has spent almost every minute of her life in the public eye. Her family became the stars of a reality show in which the Six appeared long before Hicks was born. The world was both fascinated and repulsed by her preacher father, her iron-fisted mother who pulls all the strings, and her siblings who grew to adulthood and a life of faith and service.\n\nWhen Essie's mother, Celia, discovers she is pregnant, she and the show's producers must decide what to do. Should they deport Essie out of the country for an abortion? Do they hide Essie and then pretend that Celia gave birth to a miracle baby so late in life? Or, better yet, will they marry her off, thus gathering the incredible publicity that could accompany a tumultuous romance and fairy-tale wedding?\n\nWhat Celia doesn't realize is that Essie is manipulating the situation by hooking up with classmate Roarke Richards, even though the two have never spoken to each other. Roarke has his own secrets, but is willing to help Essie sell their love story to the world. However, when he becomes part of the story himself, he realizes that Essie is more than he ever thought, and that she is not the judgmental, gullible sycophant he imagined her to be.",
